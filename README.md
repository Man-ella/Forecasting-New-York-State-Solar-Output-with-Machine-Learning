# Forecasting-New-York-State-Solar-Output-with-Machine-Learning
This project analyzes two decades of data from New York State's solar incentive program, quantifying the impact of diverse variables on expected residential solar output in the state
As part of this project, I create a machine learning model accurately forecasting New York State's 2019 residential solar output, aligning with the stateâ€™s forecast by 99.5%, hence indicating potential for future solar output projections

Dataset
Data for this study, provided by the state of New York through the New York State Research and Development Authority, outlines features of solar electric projects in New York, spanning from January 2003 to February 2018. The set contains 84721 observations (rows) and 30 features (columns)
